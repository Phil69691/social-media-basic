This shows the fact that you can upload two different "posts" and allow people to comment on the posts. Also it displays that you can add more than one post and then you can view all of them in the menu section
Improvements - add pictures
            - add a user interface
            - create the whole thing as a working app
            - make sure that the app works on phones and pcs
            - add more options such as chats

                          - you can add pictures 
                          - has to be used somewhere where the code can be read.
